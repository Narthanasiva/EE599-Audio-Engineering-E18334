# EE599 Audio Engineering: E/18/334

Welcome to my portfolio, showcasing my expertise and projects in Audio Engineering.

## WORKS
* Linear Synthesiser (Example in the class)
* Non-linear synthesizer 
* Temp separator: songs vs song, song vs vocal
* Vocal removing from a song (vocalremover.org is one of the online software used for this task) - assignment 
* Pitch Estimation - Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) - presentation
* MFCC- Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients 
* Pitch Scaling & Pitch shifting : In pitch Scaling and pitch shifting our main aim to maintain the audio duration constant. (Audacity software)
* Visualization techniques of music : scalogram, etc
* subspace filtering : In lecs
* detecting formats : need to develop format detection algorithms
* reverberation: sound goes and reflected from same surface
* Weiner filter: in lecs
* song genre visualization
